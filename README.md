# sql-injection

SQL Injection is a code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities in an application's software by inserting or "injecting" malicious SQL statements into an entry field for execution. This attack vector allows attackers to manipulate a database by executing unauthorized SQL queries, which can result in data breaches, unauthorized access, and even the complete compromise of a database system.

How SQL Injection Works
Attackers typically exploit input fields, such as login forms or search boxes, by injecting malicious SQL code into a query. If the application's code does not properly validate or sanitize user inputs, the injected code can execute unexpected commands, such as:

Bypassing authentication: By injecting SQL statements that always return true, attackers can gain unauthorized access to an application.
Extracting data: Attackers can retrieve sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card information.
Modifying or deleting data: By executing destructive SQL commands, attackers can alter or delete data in the database, leading to data loss or corruption.
Prevention
To prevent SQL Injection attacks, developers should adopt best practices such as:

Using Prepared Statements: Ensure that all SQL queries use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate code from data.
Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent malicious code from being processed.
Least Privilege Principle: Limit database user permissions to the minimum required for application functionality.
Regular Security Audits: Perform regular vulnerability assessments to identify and fix potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
By implementing these practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of SQL Injection attacks and protect your application's data integrity and security.
